Welcome to the Data Platform front door! We intend to use this site to communicate updates about the Data Platform to our users and stakeholders, and provide the essential resources for using the platform in one place.

It's important to note that this site is not the [Data Platform itself](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform), but rather an information hub that supplements the platform. As such, we are hosting it in a [separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-user-guidance) while continuing to follow Justice Digital's policy of coding in the open by default. Check out [Justice Digital's blog post on why we do this](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/21/why-we-code-in-the-open/) for more information.

We have built this site using the [GOV.UK Eleventy Plugin](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-eleventy-plugin/). Primarily a documentation tool, it allows us the flexibility to provide different types of content while utilising the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). We chose this tool after researching and comparing it alongside the [Tech Docs Template](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/) and [MkDocs Tech Docs Template](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/mkdocs-tech-docs-template/).

As we develop the Data Platform we will add new spaces and blog posts to this site, so keep checking back to view our progress. Ultimately, we want to make sure we provide as much self-service for our users as possible and keep anyone with an interest in the Data Platform up to speed on its development; we aim to achieve both using this site.

To learn more about our vision, including why we are building the Data Platform, have a read through the [About page](../../about).
